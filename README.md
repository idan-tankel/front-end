# Universaldot WEB APP: The Front-End of the digital economy

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/UniversalDot/front-end/tree/develop.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/UniversalDot/front-end/tree/develop)

In the past, people have created organizations and corporations by obtaining legal status from a government or a state. In the future, organizations and corporations will be created digitally and will have global instead of local reach. UNIVERSALDOT Foundation provides the needed infrastructure for people to organize themselves by creating digital identities and tasks. We enable the creation of a new digital future.

This repository represents the front-end of the application. It is built with [Substrate-frontend-template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template), [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and [Polkadot js API](https://polkadot.js.org/api/). Familiarity with these tools
will be helpful, but not mandatory.

## Using The Web Application

### Installation

The codebase is installed using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). This tutorial assumes you have installed yarn globally prior to installing it within the subdirectories. For the most recent version and how to install yarn, please refer to [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) documentation and installation guides. 

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UniversalDot/front-end.git
cd front-end
yarn install
```

## Usage

You can start the template in development mode to connect to a locally running node

```bash
yarn start
```

You can also build the app in production mode,

```bash
yarn build
```
and open `build/index.html` in your favorite browser.

## Configuration

The template's configuration is stored in the `src/config` directory, with
`common.json` being loaded first, then the environment-specific json file,
and finally environment variables, with precedence.

* `development.json` affects the development environment
* `test.json` affects the test environment, triggered in `yarn test` command.
* `production.json` affects the production environment, triggered in
`yarn build` command.

Some environment variables are read and integrated in the template `config` object,
including:

* `REACT_APP_PROVIDER_SOCKET` overriding `config[PROVIDER_SOCKET]`
* `REACT_APP_DEVELOPMENT_KEYRING` overriding `config[DEVELOPMENT_KEYRING]`

More on [React environment variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).

When writing and deploying your own front end, you should configure:

* Custom types as JSON in `src/config/types.json`. See
  [Extending types](https://polkadot.js.org/api/start/types.extend.html).
* `PROVIDER_SOCKET` in `src/config/production.json` pointing to your own
  deployed node.
* `DEVELOPMENT_KEYRING` in `src/config/common.json` be set to `false`.
  See [Keyring](https://polkadot.js.org/api/start/keyring.html).


## Testing

This project uses Cypress for testing. 

Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium.This enables you to write faster, easier and more reliable tests. Cypress can test anything that runs in a browser.

Cypress enables you to write all types of tests:

* End-to-end tests
* Integration tests
* Unit tests

Before running your Cypress Tests, make sure that your front end application is running locally. All tests are configured to run on localhost:8000

```bash
yarn start
```

Once your application is running locally, to launch the Cypress Test Runner run this command:

```bash
yarn run cypress open
```
You can then proceed to the Cypress UI where you can select to run individual tests or run all tests.


### Specifying Connecting Node

There are two ways to specify it:

* With `PROVIDER_SOCKET` in `{common, development, production}.json`.
* With `rpc=<ws or wss connection>` query paramter after the URL. This overrides the above setting.

## Reusable Components

### useSubstrate Custom Hook

The custom hook `useSubstrate` provides access to the Polkadot js API and thus the
keyring and the blockchain itself. Specifically it exposes this API.

```js
{
  socket,
  types,
  keyring,
  keyringState,
  api,
  apiState,
}
```

- `socket` - The remote provider socket it is connecting to.
- `types` - The custom types used in the connected node.
- `keyring` - A keyring of accounts available to the user.
- `keyringState` - One of `"READY"` or `"ERROR"` states. `keyring` is valid
only when `keyringState === "READY"`.
- `api` - The remote api to the connected node.
- `apiState` - One of `"CONNECTING"`, `"READY"`, or `"ERROR"` states. `api` is valid
only when `apiState === "READY"`.


### TxButton Component

The [TxButton](./src/substrate-lib/components/TxButton.js) handles basic
[query](https://polkadot.js.org/api/start/api.query.html) and
[transaction](https://polkadot.js.org/api/start/api.tx.html) requests to the
connected node. You can reuse this component for a wide variety of queries and
transactions. See [src/Transfer.js](./src/Transfer.js) for a transaction example
and [src/ChainState.js](./src/ChainState.js) for a query example.

### Account Selector

The [Account Selector](./src/AccountSelector.js) provides the user with a unified way to
select their account from a keyring. If the Balances module is installed in the runtime,
it also displays the user's token balance. It is included in the template already.
